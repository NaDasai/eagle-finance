### Exchange

#### Fees on EagleFi  
- Trading fees range from **0.01% to 1%**, depending on the pool.  
- A small **MAS gas fee** covers transaction processing on Massa.  

#### Price Impact  
Price impact refers to the difference between the market price and the trade execution price, influenced by trade size relative to pool liquidity.  

#### Slippage  
Slippage is the gap between expected and actual trade prices, often caused by market volatility or low liquidity. Set a **slippage tolerance** to control acceptable trade price ranges.
